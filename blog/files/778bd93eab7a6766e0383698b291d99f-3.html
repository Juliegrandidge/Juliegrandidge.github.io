But often it can be challenging especially when you&rsquo;re new to yoga, or your shoulders or legs are tired, weak or tight. <br /><br />Start from an all fours position on your mat, with your hands underneath you shoulders and knees underneath your hips. Walk your hands slightly forwards (about half of your hand&rsquo;s distance), spread your fingers as wide as you can and check your index finger is pointing straight forwards to 12 o clock. <br /><br />From there, keeping your hands pressing down into the mat, tuck your elbows under so your biceps are facing upwards - notice if this helps you to flatten your shoulder blades against the back of your ribcage.<br /><br />Tuck your toes, press the base of your index fingers down into the mat, and lift your knees. On an exhale lift your hips straight up, press your torso back towards your thighs to bring yourself into an upside down &lsquo;V&rsquo; shape. <br /><br />The aim of this pose is to create length through the spine, so keep your knees bent if that helps you to to do this. Your heels will be pressing down towards the floor, but will not necessarily touch the mat.<br /><br />Now notice if you are &lsquo;holding on&rsquo; to your head and neck. Allow the head to be heavy, try shaking and nodding your head a few times to realise any tension you might be holding. Relax your face and jaw.<br /><br />Generally in this pose feet are hip width apart and hands are about shoulder width, but try bringing the feet or the hands a little wider and see how that feels. Wider hands can be especially helpful if your shoulders are feeling tight. <br /><br /><br /></span><span style="font:11px HelveticaNeue-Bold; font-weight:bold; color:#000000;font-weight:bold; ">Alternatives<br /></span><span style="font:11px HelveticaNeue; color:#000000;"><br />Sometimes downward facing dog doesn&rsquo;t feel good, maybe you are recovering form a wrist or shoulder injury, or you have a headache or a cold that makes being upside down feel a bit rubbish. But even though downward dog features heavily in most yoga classes, there&rsquo;s no need to skip your yoga practice altogether. Try swapping downward dog for one of these:<br /><br /></span><span style="font:11px HelveticaNeue-Bold; font-weight:bold; color:#000000;font-weight:bold; ">Cat and cow stretches <br /></span><span style="font:11px HelveticaNeue; color:#000000;"><br />Starting from all fours, fingers spread wide with hands under shoulders and your knees under hips. Move with your breath - on an inhale arch your spine, drop the belly, lift your tailbone and lift your chin. With your exhales round your spine an angry cat, drawing your chin to your chest.<br /><br />Mix it up by introducing some circular movements with your hips, or try &lsquo;wagging your tail&rsquo; - shifting your hips to one side and move you head to look towards them.<br /><br />This also works on your forearms if your wrists are sensitive, or you could try having your hands in fists rather than flat on the mat.<br /><br /></span><span style="font:11px HelveticaNeue-Bold; font-weight:bold; color:#000000;font-weight:bold; ">Child&rsquo;s pose<br /></span><span style="font:11px HelveticaNeue; color:#000000;"><br />From your all fours position, bring your knees wide, your big toes together and sit your hips back onto your heels.<br /><br />This is a resting pose, so make it work for you. Your hands can be stretched out in front of you or reaching back towards your toes. You can prop your forehead up by resting it on a yoga block, a cushion or folded blanket. You could also try putting a cushion or blanket in between your hips and your heels.<br /></span><span style="font:11px HelveticaNeue-Bold; font-weight:bold; color:#000000;font-weight:bold; "><br />Puppy pose<br /></span><span style="font:11px HelveticaNeue; color:#000000;"><br />From all fours bring yourself down onto your forearms. You can stay with this, resting your head on a yoga block or stacked fists, or slide your hands further away and bring your chest, chin or forehead onto the mat. Here it can be tempting to really dip into your lower back, try to engage your core by lifting your lower belly towards your spine.<br /><br /></span><span style="font:11px HelveticaNeue-Bold; font-weight:bold; color:#000000;font-weight:bold; ">Dolphin pose<br /></span><span style="font:11px HelveticaNeue; color:#000000;"><br />This is more challenging than the other alternatives, but a great option if you want a strong pose but are struggling with sensitive wrists. <br /><br />To come into this pose, you can either move into downward facing dog and come down onto your forearms, or bring your forearms onto the mat from all fours and then lift your hips up.<br /><br />Press down into your forearms to help you engage the muscles around your shoulders.<br /><br /></span><span style="font:11px HelveticaNeue-Bold; font-weight:bold; color:#000000;font-weight:bold; ">Practice<br /></span><span style="font:11px HelveticaNeue; color:#000000;"><br />Click here for a 15 minute yoga practice that begins by opening the shoulders and the back of the legs to prepare for downward facing dog.</span></div></div>
