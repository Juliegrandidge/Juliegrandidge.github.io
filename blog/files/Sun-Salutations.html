Getting to know the basics of the movements involved is the perfect way to start your own home yoga practice. Try a few rounds of this sequence 3-5 times in the morning to help wake you up. Start with a slow round, taking a few breaths for each movement, and work up towards one breath per move.<br /><br /><strong><br /></strong><img class="imageStyle" alt="My document (4)" src="my-document-002840029.jpeg" width="525" height="525" /><strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>Pose 1: Mountain Pose (</strong><strong><em>Tadasana</em></strong><strong>)</strong><br /><br />Stand tall at the top of your mat. Take a moment to find your posture before you start to move. You can choose to have your feet hip width or together, with a small gap between your heels. Try to balance the weight of your body evenly across the soles of your feet - try rocking forwards and backwards until you find that middle ground.<br /><br />Find a level pelvis - place your hands on your hips and visualise your pelvis as a bowl of water. Tip the pelvis forwards and the water spills over the front, tip backwards and the water spills out behind you. Find that point in between where the water in the bowl would be level.<br /><br />Bring your hands alongside your body, with the thumbs pointing away from you so that your shoulders start to draw back and your chest is open.<br /><strong><br /></strong><strong>Pose 2: Upward Hands Pose (</strong><strong><em>Urdhva Hastasana</em></strong><strong>)<br /></strong><br />From Mountain Pose, take a breath in through your nose and lift your arms up overhead. You can have the hands apart (a good option for tight shoulders), or bring the palms of your hands together. Having the hands slightly forward of your face will help you to keep your arms straight without creating that squashed feeling in the tops of your shoulders.<br /><br /><strong>Pose 3: Standing forward fold (</strong><strong><em>Uttanasana</em></strong><strong>)</strong><br /><br />With a soft bend in your knees, exhale and hinge forward from your hips. You could try bring your hands onto your hips first to help you focus on bringing the movement from your hips instead of rounding through the upper back and neck. Have your knees bent as much as you need to. Try bringing your hands down onto yoga blocks, some books, a chair, or anything that helps bring the floor closer to you.<br /><br /><strong>Pose 4: Standing half forward fold</strong><strong><em> (Ardha Uttansana)</em></strong><br /><br />Inhale and lift half way up out of your forward fold - allowing your spine to lengthen. It&rsquo;s best if your hands can rest onto something here whether that&rsquo;s your props from before or your shins or thighs.<br /><br /><strong>Pose5: Plank pose </strong><strong><em>(Phalakasana)</em></strong><br /><br />Exhale and bend your knees so that you can flatten you palms on the floor. Step your feet back to bring yourself into a high plank position. You can drop your knees here, or keep them lifted for more of a challenge. Make sure your hands are pressing firmly down into the mat and your fingers are spread wide, with wrists under shoulders. Hold plank as you inhale.<br /><br /><strong>Pose 6: High to low plank </strong><strong><em>(Caturanga Dandasana)</em></strong><br /><br />Exhale to bend your elbows in towards your ribcage, lower your body in one line either all the way to the mat or pause half way down with upper arms parallel to the mat. <br /><br /><strong>Pose 7: Cobra</strong><strong><em> (Bhuganasana)</em></strong><strong> or Upward Facing Dog </strong><strong><em>(Urdhva Mukha Svanasana)</em></strong><br /><br />If you lowered all the way to the mat, inhale as you lift up your chest and shoulders. If you paused half way down, with your inhale press down into the hands and move the chest forwards and up - belly, hips, thighs and knees all hover above the mat. <br /><br />Whichever option you take press the tops of your feet down, and your shoulders back and down away from your ears.<br /><br /><strong>Pose 8: Downward Facing Dog </strong><strong><em>(Adho Mukha Svanasana)</em></strong><br /><br />Exhale and lift your hips up, roll onto the balls of your feet and press your torso back towards your thighs. Keep your fingers spread wide and press your knuckles down into the floor. Generally hands and feet are shoulder width, but try out bring them a little wider if it feels better. Knees can be bent, especially if that helps you create length through your spine.<br /><br />Stay here for 3 to 5 breaths.<br /><br /><strong>Pose 9: Standing half forward fold </strong><strong><em>(Ardha Uttansana)</em></strong><br /><br />Inhale and step or lightly hop your feet towards your hands bringing yourself back into a forward fold with a long spine - hands resting lightly on shins, thighs or any props you have.<br /><br /><strong>Pose 10: Standing forward fold (</strong><strong><em>Uttanasana</em></strong><strong>)</strong><br /><br />Exhale into a forward fold bringing the belly closer to your legs and allowing the spine to gently round.<br /><br /><strong>Pose 11:</strong> <strong>Upward Hands Pose (</strong><strong><em>Urdhva Hastasana</em></strong><strong>)</strong><br /><br />Press down through your feet, inhale and lift back up to standing with your arms overhead.<br /><br /><strong>Pose 12: Mountain Pose (</strong><strong><em>Tadasana</em></strong><strong>)</strong><br /><br />Exhale and bring hands back down by your sides.<br /><br />Repeat as many times as you like!<br /><br /></div></div>
